# Spotify-Analyser
A basic flask web application to display user's liked songs features, download liked songs' csv, download daily played history, graphs displaying daily played songs features, etc. User can select and download mp3 file of songs liked/played today (a bit glitchy though-I apologise!!ðŸ˜…).

## I) Dependencies:-
1. Flask<br>
`pip install flask`
2. Pandas<br>
`pip install pandas`
3. os<br>
`pip install os`
4. Spotipy<br>
`pip install spotipy`
5. ffmpeg<br>
`choco install ffmpeg`
6. Beautiful Soup<br>
`pip install beautifulsoup4`
7. Selenium<br>
`pip install selenium`
8. Chrome Webdriver (corresponding to your chrome version)<br>
Download chrome webdriver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and add file to PATH (System variable)
9. Requests<br>
`pip install requests`
10. youtube_dl<br>
Download youtube_dl [here](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and add youtube_dl.exe(in bin) to PATH (System variable)<br>
`pip install youtube_dl`

Next time venv please!!! (Let me know if there's any other dependency)

## II) Setting up
1. Register on Spotify Developers and create an app to get client id and client secret. 
2. In edit settings on spotify developer dashboard page, fill in redirect uri as `http://127.0.0.1:5000/redirect`
3. Create a .env file in spotify_app folder and add:<br>
CLIENT_ID = "YOUR CLIENT ID"<br>
CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR CLIENT SECRET"<br>


That should be sufficient I guess to get the flask application up and running (`python run.py`). Do let me know if I need to make any changes/furnish more details<br>

Thanks for reading through!!
